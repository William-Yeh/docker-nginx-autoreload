# Nginx with Auto-Reload


Nginx with auto-reload feature, inspired from the following work:

 - ["Nginx https service" example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/https-nginx) from the Kubernetes team.
 
 - ["Deploying Secure HTTPS NGINX in Kubernetes"](https://8gwifi.org/docs/kube-nginx.jsp) article.
